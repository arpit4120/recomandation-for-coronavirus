# **Covid-19Detector App**

**_Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)_** is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

## **_HOW IT SPREADS_**

The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.

You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth

We have a designed an application using MACHINE LEARNING that predicts the probability of a person testing positive for COVID-19 disease based on the symptoms. However the World Health Organisation (WHO) has released statistcs that 45-50% of the patients testing positive have mild or no symptoms at all. This app can only be used for the remaining cases in which symptoms are present.


In this reprositary coi file contain the data we use for pridicting the result,where as source code file  conatin the required python code.

### ***Machine learning*** is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. In this we applied different algorithoms to get best results here are our conclsions:-
